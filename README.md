### Install Dependencies

We have two kinds of dependencies in this project: tools and angular framework code.  The tools help
us manage and test the application.

* We get the tools we depend upon via `npm`, the [node package manager][npm].
* We get the angular code via `bower`, a [client-side code package manager][bower].

We have preconfigured `npm` to automatically run `bower` so we can simply do:

```
npm install
```

Behind the scenes this will also call `bower install`.  You should find that you have two new
folders in your project.

* `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the tools we need
* `app/bower_components` - contains the angular framework files

*Note that the `bower_components` folder would normally be installed in the root folder but
angular-seed changes this location through the `.bowerrc` file.  Putting it in the app folder makes
it easier to serve the files by a webserver.*

### Run the Application

We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server.  The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at `http://localhost:8000/index.html`.



## Updating Angular

Previously we recommended that you merge in changes to angular-seed into your own fork of the project.
Now that the angular framework library code and tools are acquired through package managers (npm and
bower) you can use these tools instead to update the dependencies.

You can update the tool dependencies by running:

```
npm update
```

This will find the latest versions that match the version ranges specified in the `package.json` file.

You can update the Angular dependencies by running:

```
bower update
```

This will find the latest versions that match the version ranges specified in the `bower.json` file.
